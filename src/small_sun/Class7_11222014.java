	 * Q2. An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. 
	 * Order the array elements so that positive and negative numbers are placed alternatively. 
	 * If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. 
	 * If there are more negative numbers, they too appear in the end of the array.

	 * Q3   Given an array of size n, print all possible  combinations  of k elements in array. 
	 * For example, if input array is {2, 1, 3, 4} and k == 2, 
	 * then output should be {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4} and {3, 4}.

	 * Q4.   Given an array of random numbers, 
	 * Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given array to the end of the array.
	 * For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, 
	 * it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. 
	 * The order of all other elements should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).
