	 * Largest SubMatrix Product Hard DP
	 * Given a matrix that contains doubles, find the submatrix with the largest product.
	 * Return the product of the submatrix.
	 * Assumptions
	 * The given double matrix is not null and has size of M * N, where M >= 1 and N >= 1
	 * Examples
	 * { 
	 * {1, -0.2, -1},
	 * {1, -1.5,  1},
	 * {0,    0,  1} }
	 * the largest submatrix product is 1 * 1 = 1.
