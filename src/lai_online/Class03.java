	 * Queue By Two Stacks Fair Data Structure Java: Implement a queue by using
	 * two stacks. The queue should provide size(), isEmpty(), offer(), poll()
	 * and peek() operations. When the queue is empty, poll() and peek() should
	 * return null.
	 * 
	 * C++: Implement a queue by using two stacks. The queue should provide
	 * size(), isEmpty(), push(), front() and pop() operations. When the queue
	 * is empty, front() should return -1.
	 * 
	 * Assumptions
	 * 
	 * The elements in the queue are all Integers. size() should return the
	 * number of elements buffered in the queue. isEmpty() should return true if
	 * there is no element buffered in the queue, false otherwise.
